## General Information
### Problem Statement
The data set given (loan.csv) contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to analyze the data and identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
 
In this case study, we will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
